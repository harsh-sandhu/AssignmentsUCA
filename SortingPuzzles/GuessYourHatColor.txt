In Case of hats of two colors( lets say Black and White)

Ten prisoners are in line
Now we can choose any of two given colors but lets say we choosed black one

now the prisoner at last, 10th prisoner count number of black hats

if number of black hats are even then he loudly says, BLACK!!
else he says WHITE!!

lets say number of black hats are even, and 10th prisoners says BLACK!!

now the 9th prisoner knows there are even on odd number of hats, in given case he knows 10th prisoner
say black and now he knows number of black hats are even

now 9th prisoners counts number of black hats in front of him,
if he counted hats are even, then he knows 10th prisoner said black(Even balck hats),
so he must be wearing white hat, so he says black and saves his life

in case of odd, then he must be wearing black hat and says BLACK!! and saves his life

same way goes till last prisoner......

in this way we can surely save life og 9 prisoners out of 10
